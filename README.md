# S-MST Image Segmentation
A python implementation of the method described in the paper [Sequential image segmentation based on minimum spanning tree representation](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167865516301192).

"The C++ implementation (available in my repositories) is much more faster than the python implementation."

### Dependence:
The code depends on the following third-party libraries:
- fibheap 0.2.1

```
pip install fibheap
```

### Run demo: 
```
python Demo_segmentation.py
```

### Parameters:
*``m``* : The coefficient of the parameters *``c``* that calculated automatically using the differential of the PSR-MST in the [source paper](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0167865516301192). If no value is given, the default value is ``3``.

*``l``* : The length of the scanning frame (sub-string) that scans through the PSR-MST. If no value is given, the default value is ``"scale"`` that computed by ``int( sqrt(M * N) / 2``).

### Segmentation  fuction:

 ``labels = sequential_segmentation(img)`` -----> *m* = 3, *l* = "scale"

``labels = sequential_segmentation(img, m = 4)`` -----> *l* = "scale"

``labels = sequential_segmentation(img, m = 4, l = 200)``
